# Spatial-Information-Systems

Grade: A+

Assignment questions:

1. Compare and contrast vector and raster spatial data in terms of data models, storage and
manipulation strategies, and possible applications. NOTE: This questions covers many aspects
of the module. Therefore, one of the skills you are asked to show here is the ability to
summarise the topic into a complete (i.e., it contains all relevant information) but concise
answer.
2. Discuss topological data structures for plane subdivisions. Highlight the advantages and
disadvantages of using topological data structures versus non-topological data structures for
storing and querying vector datasets.
3. Highlight the differences between the loosely coupled and the integrated approach for storing
and manipulating spatial data. Discuss what are the main advantages and disadvantages of
each approach. Explain how the integrated approach is implemented in Oracle Spatial.
4. Discuss the application of computational geometry algorithms in the context of spatial
applications. Research and discuss one computational geometry algorithm that we did not
cover in the module and explain how such an algorithm can be applied to solve a spatial
problem (i.e., how it could be used to answer one of the spatial queries discussed in the
module).
5. Introduce triangulations as particular cases of plane subdivisions. Discuss the applications of
triangulations in the context of spatial information systems as covered in the module.
Research and explain one application of triangulations that we did not cover in the module.
6. Discuss spatial indexing for vector data. Provide an example of a vector dataset and explain
how a point query would be resolved using one of the indexing approaches we studied. Explain
how in your example the query is supported by the use of the index.
