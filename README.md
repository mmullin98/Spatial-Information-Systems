# Spatial-Information-Systems

Grade: A+

Assignment questions:

1. Compare and contrast vector and raster spatial data in terms of data models, storage and
manipulation strategies, and possible applications. NOTE: This questions covers many aspects
of the module. Therefore, one of the skills you are asked to show here is the ability to
summarise the topic into a complete (i.e., it contains all relevant information) but concise
answer.

2. Discuss topological data structures for plane subdivisions. Highlight the advantages and
disadvantages of using topological data structures versus non-topological data structures for
storing and querying vector datasets.

3. Highlight the differences between the loosely coupled and the integrated approach for storing
and manipulating spatial data. Discuss what are the main advantages and disadvantages of
each approach. Explain how the integrated approach is implemented in Oracle Spatial.

6. Discuss spatial indexing for vector data. Provide an example of a vector dataset and explain
how a point query would be resolved using one of the indexing approaches we studied. Explain
how in your example the query is supported by the use of the index.
